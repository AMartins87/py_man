### **VALIDATOR TESTING**


## **BUGS**

-   I had an issue with the game when word was guessed successfully, the game wouldn't finish until user used all lives available. The issue got resolved upon changing the code which checked the lenght of the guessed letters and the play_word(masked word). However this worked only on words with non-repeating characters. If word, e.g mixin, had two or more repeating character inside, the game wouldn't count it in. The count method and counter need to be implemented.

2.  From the **Source** section drop-down menu, select the **Branch:main**
3.  Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
